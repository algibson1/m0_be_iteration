# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?

It could be useful for searching through a more extensive list of elements and printing only the ones the user is looking for.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?

I'd like to practice more commands that check a string for certain characters, like that challenge for printing only names that start with P. I'm sure there's a way to use iterations to alphabetize an array. I plan to use google and VS code to play with the methods.

- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?

What helped in my approach to these challenges and the practices on the webpage was to consider whether I wanted my output to be exclusive or inclusive. Exclusive outputs needed a conditional statement. Then from there I had to consider the conditions that needed to be met.
